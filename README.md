# Winter-Projects-2025

A central hub for all projects built during **Winter 2025**. Each project explores a high‑impact domain - Agentic AI, backend systems, embedded ML, optimizations, and scalable architecture - packaged cleanly so reviewers, recruiters, and collaborators can navigate effortlessly.

This repository acts as a structured master folder that **redirects users to individual project repositories** while maintaining a consistent layout and standardized documentation.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Agentic AI Memory Systems

This project demonstrates two fundamental memory systems for AI agents:

Short-Term Memory (STM): Maintains conversation context within a session using LangGraph's checkpoint system
Long-Term Memory (LTM): Stores and retrieves information across sessions using FAISS vector database
