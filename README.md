# Winter-Projects-2025

A central hub for all projects built during **Winter 2025**. Each project explores a high‑impact domain - Agentic AI, backend systems, embedded ML, optimizations, and scalable architecture - packaged cleanly so reviewers, recruiters, and collaborators can navigate effortlessly.

This repository acts as a structured master folder that **redirects users to individual project repositories** while maintaining a consistent layout and standardized documentation.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Agentic AI Memory Systems

This project demonstrates two fundamental memory systems for AI agents:

- Short-Term Memory (STM): Maintains conversation context within a session using LangGraph's checkpoint system
- Long-Term Memory (LTM): Stores and retrieves information across sessions using FAISS vector database

### 2. Java Embedded ML

This project focuses on embedding machine-learning models directly inside Java applications:

- Zero-overhead integration of ML into legacy Java monoliths
- Inference inside the same JVM (no microservices, no external servers)
- ONNX runtime + DJL for loading and running models
- Endpoints demonstrating model inference (e.g., iris classification)
- Architecture designed for edge devices and constrained enterprise environments

### 3. KnowledgeVault — Local Notes App (with RAG Implementation)

A privacy-focused, on-device knowledge system that converts your personal notes into a searchable, intelligent knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Designed as a completely offline alternative to cloud-based AI note systems.

- Local-first architecture with zero external API dependencies  
- Notes → chunking → embeddings → vector store pipeline  
- RAG retrieval to answer queries directly from your stored notes  
- Clean interface for adding, editing, and managing notes  
- Supports quantized local LLM inference  
- Ideal for personal assistants, study workflows, and offline knowledge engines
